# Lunar Hex Android

Lunar Hex is a simple yet challenging puzzle game with 30 levels for you to explore! The rules of the game are as follows:

1. A piece may slide in the direction of any of the 6 adjacent hexagons.
2. The piece may only slide if it will eventually come to a stop by sliding into another piece.
3. The player wins when the red piece stops sliding on the center hexagon, marked in another shade of red.

This is an Android port of my game, [Lunar Hex](https://ianscottbaker.com/game-lunar-hex "Play Lunar Hex on my website") originally written in Adobe Flash. The concept is based on the board game Lunar Lockout but with the twist of using hexagons instead of squares.

Find it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.isb.lunarhex&hl=en "Lunar Hex on Google Play") or watch the [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGA40GAv9J8 "Lunar Hex YouTube trailer") on YouTube.
